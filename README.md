A JavaScript script loader made using GraalVM JS, and it can call Java code through the Polyglot API to control the game.<br>
Example:
- Modify the block at a certain position.<br>
- Manipulate entities (such as giving items to players, setting health, or even modifying NBT!)<br>
- Customize items (name, description, right-click action, and texture)<br><br>
